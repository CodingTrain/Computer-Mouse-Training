# Computer Mouse Training

A machine learning model that predicts mouse movements.

## How To Use!

### Collecting Mouse Data

This is an optional step. See [Computer Mouse Data Repository](https://github.com/CodingTrain/Computer-Mouse-Data) for more information on how to collect data. Or you can use the example mouse data in `mouse_data`.

### Running

You'll need nodejs and npm installed if you don't already have them installed. Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) to installing them.

Run `npm install`

Run `npm start`

Once training is complete do not stop the server and you can start the MouseController sketch. Press `esc` to escape the the sketch running.
